## WeatherAnalysis

Given the year and month this model predicts the **average temperature** for that month, it does so by using K Nearest Regressor
model.

Visualizing the data We can see that the avg temp only depends on month. so we use only month to predict the average temp.

# Accuracy:

**On train : 93%**
**On test : 88%**

Since the weather depends on lot of of other variables too, this model is doing considerably well on prediciting
the average temperature.
